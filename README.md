# Video Game Sales Analysis

## Short Description

This repository contains a single Python script (`Project1.py`) that performs two main analyses on a video game sales dataset. First, it calculates and compares the average global sales before and after the year 2005. Second, it adds a new column to the dataset, categorizing each sales record based on whether the release year was before or after 2005, and saves the updated dataset to a new CSV file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Pandas library (`pip install pandas`)

### Installing

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Kirthigapriya95/Individual-Project]
    ```
   
2.  Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd Video Game Sales Analysis
    ```

## Running the Script

1.  Ensure the `vgsales.csv` file is in the same directory as the `Project1.py` script.
2.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    Project1.py
    ```
3.  The script will:
    * Print the results of the average global sales analysis for the periods before and after 2005.
    * Save the updated dataset with the `Year_Category` column to a new file named `vgsales_updated.csv`.
    * Print a sample of the updated data showing the `Year` and `Year_Category` columns.
